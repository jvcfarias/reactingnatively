<h1> My first React Native application</h1>

Hey! I'm Jo√£o Victor Farias! :smile:

The main goal here was to create a mobile app that could generate random integer numbers. I've used useState hook, as well as a number of native functions, such as **Math.random(), Math.floor()**, and **set()**. From a style perspective, the stylesheet was integrated with the code itself.

This is my first react application created as part of a bootcamp to develop a random number generator for mobile devices.
